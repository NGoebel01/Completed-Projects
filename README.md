# USA-CO2-Emissions

This project is a visualization of the changes in CO2 emissions based on time of year. Initially, a slice of data was plotted to try and identify any patterns in emissions based on time of year. It was determined that emissions were lowest in April/September and highest in January/July. Once a pattern was identified, a visualization was created to show the difference in select highest and lowest values.

What causes the fluctuation in emissions? Initial thinking is that because these emissions are caused by burning coal, they will be highest in the hottest and coldest months when homes need to be heated and cooled. April/September being in Spring/Fall mean temperatures are likely more comfortable, thus reducing the need for coal and energy in general. Further exploration is needed to determine if this trend extends to other energy sources, such as natural gas and possibly renewables.
